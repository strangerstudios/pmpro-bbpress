Restrict access to bbPress for free or premium members by integrating bbPress with the top WordPress membership plugin Paid Memberships Pro.

== Description ==

### The most popular WordPress plugin for private forums.

Use bbPress and Paid Memberships Pro to create a private forum in your WordPress site. This plugin enables secure, private discussion boards for members of your free or paid community.

= Private Forums: Restrict Forum Access by Level =
With private forums, all content in the forum is secured from public view. Select the membership levels that are allowed to access the restricted forum. Any member, user, or visitor without access is blocked from viewing forums, topics, and replies.

* Members get quick access to the private forum on the "Member Links" section of the "Membership Account" page.
* Site admins can optionally choose to hide the forum name from the forums list and search results.
* To create a better forum experience for your members, choose from the settings to "Hide Forum Roles" and "Show Membership Levels" in replies and on the bbPress profile page. This helps participants see what level of membership access another member has.

= Forum Roles: Set Forum Role by Membership Level =
Give certain membership levels a higher tier of access within your forum. Assign the forum role by membership level in your Paid Memberships Pro settings. This forum role is changed or removed from the member when their membership level changes.

For example, allow certain membership levels to be spectators in the forum, while you allow other higher tier members access to moderate forum replies.
